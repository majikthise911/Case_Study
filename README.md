### TITLE DYDX: Perpetual Trading With Your Own Keys 
## Overview and Origin 

DeFi is an abbreviation for decentralized finance. Given that centralization is in the name and specifically its un-affiliation with centralization suggests that there is a significant difference between a centralized and de-centralized exchange. 

A centralized exchange operates in a similar way to a bank. Tokens or funds are deposited, and the exchange serves as the custodian of these funds. The funds are in the hands of the exchange, and it is up to the exchange to safeguard the funds and ensure they can be withdrawn upon request. If crypto currencies are stored on a centralized exchange, the blockchain record will show the exchange as the owner of the funds, and the exchange keeps its own ledger of who owns which tokens. 

Decentralized exchanges or DEXs work differently since they do not take custody of funds. Funds are instead transferred between individual wallets using smart contracts. DeFi


* Name of company
* When was the company incorporated? 
* Who are the founders of the company?


DYDX is a decentralized exchange incorporated in 2017 by Antonio Juliano, ex software engineer at Coinbase, uber and mongo DB. Juliano graduated from Princeton with a CS degree in 2017. DYDX runs on automated smart contracts on Ethereum. This automation eliminates the need to trust a central exchange while trading. Users can trade perpetuals, margin and spot positions as well as borrow and lend with pools on Ethereum. Users that provide liquidity to the pools on Ethereum can earn interest or take loans out for a nominal fee. The liquidity pools also allow the margin trading with different leverages. 


* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

Antonio Juliano explains in an interview with Forbes that the idea seemed like a logical next step after studying financial markets and comparing these studies to where the crypto market was currently in its evolution. Antonio explained the evolution as first, an asset is created, then its traded on spot exchanges and then assets are traded on margin exchanges and eventually derivatives are created to trade on top of that asset. Antonio launched DYDX in late 2017, at the peak of the initial coin offering boom and procured $2 million in seed funding from well-known venture capital firms [1]. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 

The company was funded by raising $87MM over 4 rounds of funding starting in December of 2017 and ending in Jun of 2021. 

The first funding round was called the seed round and was announced Dec 19th, 2017. $2MM was raised by 14 investors with the lead investors being Polychain, a San Francisco based investment firm that focuses on blockchain technologies, and Andreessen Horowitz, a California based venture capital firm. 

The second round of funding took place October 19th 2018 and raised $10MM and had 13 total investors with the same two lead investors contributing the majority of funding. 

The third round of funding raised occurred January 26th 2021 with 10 investors raising $10MM. This time the lead investors were Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund, and Definance Capital, a DeFi focused crypto asset fund. 

The final round of funding took place on Jun 15th 2021 and raised $65MM with 18 investors and one lead investor, Paradigm, another California based hedge fund [2]. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

DYDX is a decentralized exchange that aims to increase security, transparency, speed, and eliminate the need to trust a centralized exchange. It also provides a platform for later stage trading tools such as margin and derivative trading in cryptocurrencies. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

This market intends to serve anyone who wishes to trade in perpetuals and gain leverage in the crypto market. In the first quarter of 2021 a study by Tokeninsight I looked at 51 asset exchanges related to perpetuals. They reported $14.32 trillion. The main solution that DYDX offers that other perpetual exchanges do not is decentralization. The unfair advantage that decentralization gives DYDX is the fact that there is no governing body that regulators can pressure. Even individuals in countries that do not allow access to perpetuals can trade on DYDX [12]. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

For application and data, DYDX uses React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, CloudFlare, for performance and security, Amazon CloudFront, for content delivery with low latency and high data transfer speeds.

For utilities, DYDX uses Gatsby, a free open source framework for building websites and apps with React. These can be found at [stacksharel.io](https://stackshare.io/dydx/dydx) [13]. 


Starkware is a significantly speeds up transactions made on Ethereum. Before Starkware, people trading on Ethereum based DeFi exchanges often would have to wait 60 seconds or more for a trade to finalize and would have to pay expensive gas fees of between $50 and over $%150 per trade. Starkware lowers the gas fees and DYDX pays them [3]. 


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? 

DYDX is in the decentralized finance domain and more specifically financial derivatives within the DeFi domain. Decentralized finance uses the same blockchain technology cryptocurrencies use. A blockchain is a distributed and secured database or ledger. Applications called dApps are then used to handle transactions and run the blockchain [4]. 

A derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying entity. 

A perpetual is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at some point in the future. 

A perpetual is basically an option contract but with no expiration. An option contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at some point in the future [5]. Perpetual futures are cash-settled and can be held indefinitely without a need to roll over contracts as the expiration approaches. Payments are exchanged between holders of the opposite ends of the contracts. The long and short. The direction and magnitude of the settlement is based on the difference between the contract price the underlying asset and leverage. 


Transactions are recorded in clusters called blocks. These blocks of transactions are then verified by other users. If the blocks are verified as legitimate, they are closed, and a new block is created that also contains the information from the previous block within it creating a chain of blocks or a blockchain. 

Due to the nature of these blocks being linked together, the information from the previous blocks cannot be changed without affecting the preceding blocks. This concept is responsible for the secure nature of blockchains and why they are considered extremely difficult if not impossible for all practical purposes to be changed [6]. 


* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 

Liquidity: 

Being that defi is so new the trends over the last 10 years also represent its whole evolution lifecycle. In financial markets liquidity is one of the most important aspects and one of the most underestimated. High liquidity results in tighter spreads and better market efficiency. Low liquidity embellishes market movements and amplifies sell offs.

The first iteration of DeFi did not have liquidity figured out yet. It behaved like a vacuum and relied on captive capital. This capital was locked in protocols or allocated within them in inefficient ways. This creates opportunity costs since this capital could have been used otherwise in more effective ways. For example, MakerDAO required a minimum 150% collateralization ratio and lending pools had not yet been introduced to superfluid collateral [7]. 

Stable coins play an important role in the DeFi market’s liquidity. In the conception of the DeFi market exchanges relied on overcollateralized coins to maintain their peg to the fiats that back them. This makes them difficult to scale since there are significant amounts of capital that are being inefficiently used as collateral and the purely algorithmic, uncollateralized stablecoins have not yet been able to perform as intended. The latest iterations of stablecoins, such as FEI, OHM, and FLOAT, leverage protocol-controlled value (PVC)[8]. PVC is a concept where the collateral backing the stablecoin is not redeemable by the users but is owned by the protocol. This allows the colterol to be immediately transformed into liquidity which is referred to as an automated market maker (AMM). 

Leverage: 

Leverage acts as an amplifier in either direction. It will amplify gains as well as losses. In DeFi, creating leverage is an easy task, however, controlling it is much more difficult. Much of the volatility in the markets during the summer of 2020 can be traced to leverage strategies that relied on recursive yield farming and liquidity mining [7]. More recently new leverage instruments have been emerging such as Element’s Yield Token Compounding. When a user deposits collateral via Element, two tokens are mined: a principal token and a yield token. If this user deposited a principal of 10 ETH at 20% APY, the token holder can sell the principal token at a discount. At a fixed rate yield of 10%, they would receive 9 ETH while maintaining exposure to the interest paid on all 10 ETH over time via the yield token. The user can then open a new position with the remaining 9 ETH and repeat, realizing up to 6.5 times leverage. This differs from earlier lending protocols because the user can earn interest on the full principal amount, while being able to access the loans. 



Risk: 

With emerging markets risk is mostly seen in binary terms, risk-on or risk-off. As these markets evolve and the components that make the risk is better understood, risk transfer mechanisms develop, as does a sliding scale of risk. As markets evolve, volatility products start to develop. The VIX, is an index that represents the market’s estimate of future volatility and is foundational to traditional financial markets. Centralized finance markets (CeFi) offer some volatility products such as FTX MOVE, however, DeFi has a more premature volatility market. DeFi volatility protocols are developing what has been referred to as “risk-matching engines” to pair market participants who seek lower risk with others that prefer more [8]. This is mostly being done via a multi-token system that separates speculative versus non-speculative aspects of protocols and redistributes the cash flows accordingly. Using Element again, it splits principal and yield. This allows users to purchase the net present value (NPV) of the principal or take up to 10x leverage. This protocols ultimately allow for peer-to-peer risk transfer and for participants to bet on different components of the capital structure. 

Arbitrage: 

Arbitrage increases market efficiency and results in narrower spreads and increases competition [8]. Uniswap relies on arbitrageurs to maintain price discovery. In DeFi Arbitrage is still evolving. Gas fees create a scaling issue in DeFi in general, but particularly with arbitrage opportunity. As these fees goe down, the opportunities for arbitrage will increase and influence how the next DeFi iterations evolve.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? 

DYDX is a platform that combines the advantages in DeFi with the more advanced trading opportunities that can be found in perpetuals. Therefore, the impacts of both technologies can be expected with DYDX’s adoption. The advantages that DYDX brings from DeFi are security, control over funds, privacy, financial inclusion. Greater regulatory pressure has caused many centralized exchanges to restrict access to users in certain countries. DeFi exchanges are a way for people in any location to trade currencies, since there is no central authority that can be subjected to shut down. The addition of perpetuals to the DYDX equation of market impact just takes the DeFi advantages and adds the ability to access higher leverage and different investment vehicles with the use of perpetuals. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? 

When evaluating DeFi ecosystems there are several important metrics to understand and assess. Total value locked (TVL) is one of these core metrics. This refers to the total amount of cryptocurrency users have staked on DeFi protocols. Trading volume is another important metric to look at. This metric measures the total value of trades that occur on an exchange in a given time period. Daily and monthly are two popular time frames to use when evaluating DeFi protocols. Loans originated is important when examining the success of a lending platform. Average collateralization is a metric for money required to receive a loan. Higher collateralization percentages require borrowers to fund their loans with more money. Typically, more successful DeFi projects have lower average collateralization [9]. 


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? 

[DYDX Metrics Dashboard](https://metabase.dydx.exchange/public/dashboard/5fa0ea31-27f7-4cd2-8bb0-bc24473ccaa3)

TVL = $986.944MM
30 Day Trading Volume = $2,552,770,909
7 Day Trading Volume = $819,022,939	
1 Day Trading Volume = $84,316,087	

FTX
TVL = NA
30 Day Trading Volume = $1,376,825,528
7 Day Trading Volume = $944,006,314		
1 Day Trading Volume = $45,525,000	

UNISWAP
TVL = $7.53b
30 Day Trading Volume = $4,063,733,542
7 Day Trading Volume = $1,873,096,753
1 Day Trading Volume = $142,242,105	

Above are DYDX’s core metrics in comparison with two of the other larger DeFi platforms. DYDX comes in between the two in terms of trading values and 8x less TVL than Uniswap. An unofficial metric that I like to consider is how regulators view them. If regulators show significant interest in banning or highly regulating a protocol, it likely has high potential to have an impact in some way.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

If I were to advise DYDX there are 4 things that I would recommend that they introduce some way for users to either have access to undercollateralized or zero collateralized loans or implement an alternative strategy for users to benefit from their capital while it is being used as collateral. 

Under collateralized loans would allow users to more efficiently utilize capital. When loans are fully collateralized, they require a one-to-one ratio of collateral to loan. This means that there is a significant amount of capital locked in as collateral for the loan that could otherwise be utilized. The exact technology to achieve undercollateralized lending in DeFi remains conceptual. To date there have been no fully functional protocols to achieve this milestone. 

There is an alternative approach to the time value of money loss. This approach has been administered by Alchemix, which allows borrowers to benefit from the overcollateralization. If a user deposits 1000 DAI, they can access 500 alUSD. The 1000 DAI that was used as collateral is put in a Yearn vault to earn yield, which is used to pay down the loan over time. DYDX could implement such a system to
